                                <p>Welcome to South India!
                                    <p>South Indian culture refers to the culture of the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. South Indian culture though with its visible differences forms an important part of the Indian culture.</p>
                                    <p> The South Indian Culture is essentially the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body and motherhood.</p>
                                    <p> Like a giant wedge plunging into the ocean, South India is the subcontinent's steamy heartland – a lush contrast to the peaks and plains up north.</p>
                                    <p> Wherever you go in the south you'll be bumping into the magnificent relics of the splendid civilisations that have inhabited this land over two millennia – the amazing rock-cut shrines carved out by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains at Ajanta and Ellora.</p>
                                    <p> The palaces, tombs, forts and mosques of Muslim dynasties on the Deccan; Tamil Nadu's inspired Pallava sculptures and towering Chola temples; the magical ruins of the Vijayanagar capital at Hampi…and a whole lot more. It's a diverse cultural treasure trove with few parallels.</p>
                                    <p>Thousands of kilometres of coastline frame fertile plains and rolling hills in South India – a constantly changing landscape kept glisteningly green by the double-barrelled monsoon. The palm-strung strands and inland waterways of the west give way to spice gardens, tea plantations, tropical forests and cool hill-station retreats in the Western Ghats. Visit adn live the freshn beauty of the magnificant love and life!</p>

                                <p>Welcome to Coast India!
                                    <p>India has immense potential in the coastal tourism segment. However, the development of coastal tourism is tied to the concept of sustainable tourism. We need to understand the complexity of the linkage between social and natural systems. Our focus is to promote local tourism in Indian coastal belt along with awareness campaign for conservation of natural flora and fauna.</p>
                                    <p> India offers a lavish panorama, magnificent historical sites, sunny beaches, misty mountain hideaways, lively people, an ancient civilization, and vibrant festivals.</p>
                                    <p> Spread out on the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, India also offers an amazing array of beaches on its East Coast.</p>
                                    <p> If we move northwards on the East Coast from its extreme south, while traversing the beaches around Andaman and Nicobar Islands, there are the beaches of Tamilnadu, Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and finally West Bengal.</p>
                                    <p> To discover uncontaminated natural grandeur, Andaman beaches are the last word. The clear crystal sea, feather-touch sand, captivating greenery, and a range of water sports, these beaches provide a perfect getaway to beach lovers.</p>
                                    <p> Most of the tourists to these islands frequent Corbynâ€™s Cove, shaded by coconut trees, in view of its divine beauty and convenience. The Chiriya Tapu beach and the beaches of Clinque Island also offer a heavenly bliss. Virgin loveliness of Havelock Island and Little Andaman is just overwhelming.</p>
